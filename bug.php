This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling. The `strpos` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, but `false` also evaluates to 0 in a boolean context.  This means the conditional `if (strpos($haystack, $needle) !== false)` will only be true if the needle is found *and* it is found at an index other than 0. If the needle is found at index 0, the condition will be false, leading to unexpected behavior.
